  - Had issues while setting up necessary tools in linux, so switched to windows
  - As a result OS specific notes like commands, locations will all be included for ü™ü but only a few for üêß
  - Commands that are mentioned are sometimes alias(set up in env) of the orginal file/script's name(only a few are mentioned in the notes) but are semantically equivalent
