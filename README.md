### Repo contains [NOTES](./NOTES.md) taken from Android App Hacking - Black Belt Edition along with APKS(compiled & decompiled), source files & POCs

### NOTE:
  - Had issues while setting up necessary tools in linux, so switched to windows
  - As a result OS specific notes like commands, locations will all be included for 🪟 but only a few for 🐧
  - Some commands that are mentioned are sometimes alias(set up in env) of the orginal file/script's name and not the real name(only a few are mentioned in the notes) but are semantically correct
